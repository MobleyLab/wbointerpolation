# By molecule experiment [WIP]

## General

The following scripts are to run fitting experiments on single torsion profiles in a parameter 'TIG-fit0'

## Contents

* 'test.offxml' : the force field used in the fitting experiments, in the /forcefield/ directory
* 'kversusWBOplots_cleanup.ipynb' : notebook that contains the fitting experiment code [WIP]
* targets directory contains the targets used in the forcebalance run
* 'sterics_data.pkl' : contains steric data that can be used for filtering molecules with high steric interactions
