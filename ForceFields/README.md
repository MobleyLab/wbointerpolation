# Force fields for proposed WBO interpolated torsion parameters

This repository contains the .offxml file format force fields for forcebalance refitting experiments.
These parameters were adapted from Chris Bayly's initial guess smarts for WBO interpolated parameters, round 0.

## Manifest
* `openff-1.2.1-biaryl.offxm` - Proposed parameters are TIG0 through TIG8
* `openff-1.2.1-phenyl.offxm` - Proposed parameters are T1i through t7i
* `openff-1.2.1-combined.offxm` - Contains both sets of parameters TIG0 through TIG8 and T1i through t7i.
